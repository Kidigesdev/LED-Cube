# LED-Cube
Soft and Hardware for a 7x7x7 LED-Cube

Ignore the First Tab in the .fzz I dont know what happend but I only used and needed the PCB Layout.

If you can, uploud the code first to an Arduino with Atmega328p and remove the chip from it for the PCB.

The PCB design is not beautiful but it works.
The hole PCB is designed for THT. I have not made an SMD version.

Parts list:
  must have:
    49x 220Ω Resistor  (R1 - R49)
     1x 10KΩ Resistor  (R50)
     7x  1KΩ Resistor  (R51 - R57)
     2x Ceramic Capacitor 22µF
     1x Pushbutton
     1x 16MHz Crystal
     1x 74HC138  (DIP-16)
     7x 74HC574  (DIP-20)
     1x ATmega 328P
     7x 2N2222 Transistor
     1x Dual Terminal for power delivery
     Some Female Jumpersockets
     
  optinal:
    1x IC Socket DIP-28
    7x IC Socket DIP-20
    1x IC Socket DIP-16

  I made my project from his project but only on a PCB.
  Thanks for your Work
