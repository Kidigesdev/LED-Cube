# LED-Cube
Soft and Hardware for a 7x7x7 LED-Cube

Ignore the First Tab in the .fzz I dont know what happend but I only used and needed the PCB Layout.

If you can, upload the code first to an Arduino with Atmega328p and remove the chip from it for the PCB.

The PCB design is not beautiful but it works.

  I made my project from his project but only on a PCB.
  Thanks for your Work
